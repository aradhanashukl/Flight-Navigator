# Flight-Navigator
In this Flight Navigator system, I used the concepts of Data Structures and algorithms
In this the person, can act as user to get the shortest path to reach from source to destination and as a faculty to add remove flights and airports
Airports are acting as nodes and flights as edges, with distance,time and prices, they act as directed edge
I used the pointers to represent the airports and flights, so that when we want to delete or add node, we can do that easily, without any difficulty.
I used then Dijkstra shortes path algorithm to treverse the path
